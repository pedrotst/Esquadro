# Esquadro
A set of tools to collect and analyze the code's metrics in order to keep a datawarehouse.

## Description
Esquadro was born from some works in University of Bras√≠lia, through some final papers that used a methodology developed by professor [P. Meirelles](https://fga.unb.br/paulormm/).

## Main Technologies
Esquadro is based on pentaho dataintegration and pentaho biserver, using [Analizo](https://github.com/analizo/analizo) to extract metrics.

See [wiki](https://github.com/UnBazar/esquadro/wiki/1.-Home) to more information about instalation and tutorials.
